# Tic Tac Toe

W12D1 Technical Module
Make a command line tic-tac-toe game from scratch for two players.

# Expected Features

* Minimal UI that redraws the board and makes clear whose turn it is, each turn.
* Players can submit moves (assume, admittedly unrealistically, that both players are sitting at the same keyboard).
* Win detection - detect and display who won

# Bonus Goals

* Structure your code such that the UI can be turned easily into a native mobile app (iOS say) without having to rewrite the core game logic.
* Implement win detection with a functional rather than iterative style.
* Between moves, rotate the board 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The moves "fall" due to "gravity", post-rotation.
